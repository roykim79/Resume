				<h3>Team Buffet USA</h3>
				<p>Not realizing the homework assignment for week 3 was in reference to this site, I decided to make a site for the future reality stars known as Team Buffet USA. <strong>WARNING!</strong> if you lack a sense of humor or are easily offended by vulgar language and/or sexual references, move one. Otherwise, you can see it <a href="http://roykim79.github.io/tbusa/" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Take 2 can be seen <a href="tb2/index.html">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Weather Application</h3>
				<p>This experiment was definitely a great exercise for everything I have learned up to this point. It challenged and strengthened my ability to implement and use the box theory and various CSS properties. I also learned that building a page is much easier when you plan first. The outcome can be seen <a href="weather/index.html">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Alerts</h3>
				<p>This was not as easy as I thought it would be. But definitely a great learning exercise. I managed to duplicate it but unable to find icons suitable. Instead I just threw a Facebook icon in there as a substitute. You can see it <a href="alerts/index.html">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Calendar</h3>
				<p>More experiments, more problems. I felt the hardest part about this experiment was trying to do this and keeping things tidy.  I'm also discovering the diffculty in giving div's a class name that make sense and are consistent with their actions while maintaining flexibilty to change. Again I learn with these experiments that it's much easier to do this if you plan ahead. I think the majority of my time spent on this was deciding how I was gonna tackle this project and coming up with class names. Anyways, you can see how it turned out <a href="calendar/index.html">here</a>.</p>
