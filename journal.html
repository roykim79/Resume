		<h3>How I Wound Up at TSL</h3>
		<p>
			The first thing I did to learn how to code was picking up one of those <i>FOR DUMMIES</i> books on coding and after about 60 pages or so I felt like a dummy. I knew this wasn't going to work. The next thing I did was turn to my best friend <a href="http://google.com" target="blank">Larry Page</a>. I learned so much from him and he's always there for me. He referred me to a bunch of free online courses and again, I knew this wasn't going to work. I had to have a real person teach me and looked into different colleges. One night I was out drinking with some friends and I was talking about this with one of my friends in the field and she said "My co-worker <a href="http://www.shayhowe.com" target="blank">Shay</a> teaches a class in the evenings at this place called code academy, he's <strong>awesome</strong>" (she really did use the word <strong>awesome</strong>). I went to the open house and all the reservations I had about spending $2000 for a 10 week course went out the window.

		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>
			It's been nearly a decade since I sat in a class. The anxiety was kicking in and I had no idea what to expect. I'm sitting in a classroom with a bunch of people I only know by email address and follow on the twitter account I opened because some guy named Mike McGee suggested it. Now it's time for each of us to stand up and introduce ourselves! I am not a fan of public speaking.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now the learning begins. Tags, ID's, elements, classes? Say what???? Then it slowly started to all make sense. The rest of the week I'm going over the notes and next thing you know, I'm making a web page. It's looking ok for a guy who didn't know a thing about coding a few days ago. I'm feeling good. Just one more step, add the reset. <b>WTF</b> just happened!?!? I thought I was wrapping things up only to realize I was just starting.
		</p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>
			I'm feeling good until <b>Git</b> shows up and ruins the party. I'm staring at something they call a terminal like a deer in headlights.
