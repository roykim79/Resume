			</div>
			<div class="col-3">
				<p>Born and raised in Chicago, Roy spent the greater portion of his life disappointing his parents with his lack of ambition and apathy. Now he is motivated by dreams of fame, fortune and an endless list of women hoping to see their name next to his Facebook status of "In a relationship with:". He spends most of his time in casinos with other degenerates and just recently decided that learning to code was a good idea.</p>
