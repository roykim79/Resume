				<p>Born and raised in Chicago, Roy spent the greater portion of his life finding a career path he enjoys. He eventually quit his job to play poker full-time. After three years he realized it's a hard way to make an easy living. After taking a career personality test he decided programming might be a good fit and enrolled in the Beginner HTML/CSS course at The Starter League. He enjoyed it so much he applied and is now enrolled in the Advanced HTML/CSS course for this summer.</p>
