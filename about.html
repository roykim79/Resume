				<p>Born and raised in Chicago, Roy spent the greater portion of his life disappointing his parents with his lack of ambition and apathy. Now he is motivated by dreams of fame, fortune and an endless list of women hoping to see their name next to his Facebook status of "In a relationship with:". Recently, he decided learning how to code was a good idea and now spends his free time building websites that may get 10 hits at most.</p>
